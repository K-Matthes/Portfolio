    Purpose: The purpose of this file is to experiment more with CSS, while creating
    themed pages of with different content on each. For my overall theme, I decided to 
    do TV shows, in particular, TV that I love. seventys.html features That 70's Show, 
    and I tried by best to make this page groovy and true to 70's themes.
