    Purpose: The purpose of this file is to experiment more with CSS, while creating
    themed pages of with different content on each. For my overall theme, I decided to 
    do TV shows, in particular, TV that I love. index.html features American Sitcom, "The
    Office". I tried my best to adhere to muted office colored themes to capture the mood
    of the TV show.

            The Office is an American television sitcom that was adapted from the UK version of the
            show, led by Ricky Gervais. This documentary style comedy follows a small paper company
            called Dunder Mifflin, in the small town of Scranton Pennsylvania. Within the first few
            episodes of the show, you meet unpredictable branch manager, Michael Scott, likable Jim
            Halpert, quirky Pam Beesly, and many more unique and funny characters. In its early years,
            The Office was picked up by NBC and continued on for 8 lovable seasons. This show is 
            considered a fan favorite, and is now featured on many streaming sites such as Peacock and 
            Netflix.
