     <h2>Creating an Account</h2>
     <p> 
         To create an account, pick an avaliable username and preferred
         password. If the username is already taken by an existing user,
         you will have to pick another one. 
     </p>

         you account will be created and you will be able to login!

     <h2>Logging in</h2>
     <p>
        After creating your account, you can successfully log into your account. If your 
        account exists, you will be redirected to the home page. If not, you will get a 
        message saying that the account does not exist. If this happens, check your 
        credentials to make sure everything is spelled correctly. Otherwise, create a 
        new account and try again!
